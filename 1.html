  </p><p style="margin-top:66px;">Iron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day, 25 December 1975 by bassist Steve Harris shortly after he left his previous group, Smiler. Harris attributed the band's name to a film adaptation of The Man in the Iron Mask from the novel by Alexandre Dumas, the title of which reminded him of the iron maiden torture device.[65] They originally had the name Ash Mountain, but most of the band members preferred the name Iron Maiden anyway so that name was chosen shortly after the band formed.
